<p>I am an experienced software developer with over 14 years of expertise in Java and C++ programming languages. My passion lies in contributing to open-source projects, with a particular interest in decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and open-source AI. If you need help with any of my open-source projects, don't hesitate to contact me - I always strive to help and give back to the community. Currently, I run a software development company in Connecticut, having been born in the Bronx.</p>
<p>My current project is an open-source bot that facilitates triangular arbitrage between multiple decentralized exchanges. It is highly effective and profitable, searching for lucrative trades and executing them on behalf of the user. In a closed test run over 30 days, the bot generated a profit of 21.73 Ethereum starting with 1.89 Ethereum. The project is free and the official GitHub repository for version 4. It is important to note that a helpful tester has created a video tutorial, providing step-by-step instructions on how to run the program.</p>
